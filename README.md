# TrollLock Reborn
TrollLock tweak (https://github.com/verygenericname/TrollLock) port for iOS 15 and up to iOS 16.1.2. Yes, I said iOS 16! No checkm8, jailbreak or anything, just using the [MacDirtyCow exploit](https://github.com/zhuowei/MacDirtyCowDemo/blob/main/vm_unaligned_copy_switch_race.c). This is kind of a POC tester, but an actual tweak to iOS that works. Reboot your device to revert the changes.

# Instructions
1. Follow the instructions from in my Discord server (https://discord.gg/4EFEYnFb7x) in #trolllock channel. The message with the instructions should be pinned.
2. Press the start button
3. Press the first option
4. Choose the folder
- The first one is most likely for the 14 Pro & Pro Max
- The 3rd one should work for most notched devices
- If you have an iPhone XR or 11, use the 4th one
5. The app should crash, that's fine. If you are on iOS 16.1 and lower, re-open the app and press the Respring button (second option after pressing start). If you are on iOS 16.1 and up, follow this video: https://youtu.be/TaloWZysK_g

**Might not work for the first time! Try a few times, and each time respring afterwards**
